## ACTIVITY-SPECIFIC FACILITATOR GUIDES

### Activity 1: Dashboard Health Check (15 minutes)

#### Learning Objectives
- Navigate CloudWatch dashboards effectively
- Interpret operational metrics for financial processes
- Identify control weaknesses through monitoring data
- Document findings using structured audit approach

#### Expected Findings (Answer Key)

**Dashboard Metrics (Simulated Data):**
- Daily Transaction Success Rate: 92-98%
- Failed Transactions: 15-30 per day (normal range)
- Month-End Close Status: Should show some recent partial failures
- Compliance Score: Fluctuates between 78-95%

**Red Flags Teams Should Identify:**
1. Compliance score drops below 85% (2-3 times per week)
2. Month-end close process exceeding normal 3-hour window
3. Error rate spikes during high-volume periods
4. Reconciliation variances > $50,000 threshold

**Strong Team Responses Include:**
- Specific metric values with timestamps
- Pattern recognition (errors correlate with volume)
- Risk assessment linking metrics to financial reporting impact
- Practical next steps (not just "investigate further")

#### Facilitator Coaching Points

**If Teams Are Struggling:**
- Guide them to the SOX Compliance dashboard specifically
- Ask: "What would concern you if you were signing off on financial statements?"
- Point to time-series charts: "Do you see any unusual patterns?"
- Encourage: "Think like a CFO - what metrics matter most?"

**Advanced Discussion Prompts:**
- "How would you set appropriate alert thresholds?"
- "What additional metrics would improve this dashboard?"
- "How does this compare to manual sampling approaches?"

**Common Mistakes to Address:**
- Focusing on technical details vs. business impact
- Not documenting specific values/timestamps
- Failing to assess materiality of findings

#### Timing Management
- **0-5 minutes:** Teams access dashboard, orient to layout
- **5-12 minutes:** Data collection and worksheet completion
- **12-15 minutes:** Final assessment questions and key finding

---

### Activity 2: Log Investigation (25 minutes)

#### Learning Objectives
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for root cause analysis
- Construct effective log queries for audit purposes
- Document audit findings with sufficient evidence
- Assess control effectiveness based on system responses

#### Expected Investigation Results

**Sample Query That Works:**
```
fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream
| filter @message like /ERROR/ or @message like /FAIL/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

**Typical Findings:**
1. **Database Connectivity Issues:**
   - Pattern: Cluster of timeouts during peak processing
   - Duration: Usually 15-30 minute windows
   - Impact: 200-500 transactions affected per incident

2. **Validation Failures:**
   - Cause: Data quality issues from upstream systems
   - Pattern: Steady rate (5-10 per hour) during month-end
   - Resolution: Automatic retry succeeds 80% of time

3. **Performance Degradation:**
   - Threshold exceeded: Processing time >120 seconds
   - Trigger: Transaction volume >1000/minute
   - Recovery: Auto-scaling resolves within 10 minutes

#### Sample Error Messages (Training Environment)
```
2024-01-15T14:23:45 ERROR: Database connection timeout after 30 seconds
2024-01-15T14:24:12 WARN: Validation rule VR-001 failed for account 12345
2024-01-15T14:25:30 ERROR: Reconciliation variance $87,543 exceeds threshold
2024-01-15T14:26:15 INFO: Retry attempt 2/3 initiated
2024-01-15T14:27:45 SUCCESS: Recovery completed, processing resumed
```

#### Assessment Rubric

**Excellent Investigation (90-100 points):**
- Constructs targeted queries to isolate relevant errors
- Identifies specific time periods and quantifies impact
- Connects technical errors to business processes
- Documents sufficient evidence for audit workpapers
- Correctly assesses control effectiveness and gaps

**Good Investigation (80-89 points):**
- Uses basic queries effectively to find errors
- Documents key findings with some detail
- Shows understanding of business impact
- Makes reasonable control assessments

**Needs Improvement (70-79 points):**
- Successfully accesses logs but struggles with analysis
- Limited connection between technical and business issues
- Incomplete documentation of findings

#### Facilitator Interventions

**If Teams Can't Find Errors:**
```sql
-- Provide this starter query:
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @logStream like /daily-transaction-processor/
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 25
```

**If Teams Are Overwhelmed:**
- Focus on one log stream at a time
- Ask: "What happened right before this error?"
- Encourage: "Look for patterns in timing or message types"

**Advanced Teams:**
- Challenge them to quantify business impact in dollars
- Ask them to assess adequacy of error handling
- Have them design improved monitoring strategies

### Activity 3: Access Control Investigation (20 minutes)

#### Learning Objectives
- Navigate CloudTrail event history effectively
- Identify segregation of duties violations
- Assess adequacy of access controls for financial processes
- Document security findings for audit purposes

#### Expected CloudTrail Findings

**Authorized Access Patterns:**
- Business hours (8 AM - 6 PM EST) activity by finance team
- Scheduled system processes running overnight
- Standard administrative actions by IT personnel

**Potential Red Flags (Simulated):**
1. **Weekend Override Event:**
   - User: mjohnson@company.com
   - Event: ModifyFunctionConfiguration
   - Time: Saturday 2:47 AM
   - Assessment: Could be legitimate emergency response OR unauthorized change

2. **Role Assumption Pattern:**
   - User: contractor_temp@company.com
   - Events: Multiple AssumeRole calls
   - Duration: 6-hour session on Sunday
   - Assessment: Possible segregation of duties violation

3. **Geographic Anomaly:**
   - Standard user access typically from 192.168.1.x range
   - New access from 203.45.67.x (different geographic region)
   - Assessment: Could indicate compromised credentials

#### Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Event Discovery**
Teams should filter CloudTrail for:
- Time Period: Previous weekend (Friday 6 PM - Monday 6 AM)
- Event Names: CreateFunction, UpdateFunctionConfiguration, StartExecution, ConsoleLogin, AssumeRole
- Focus on unusual users, times, or source IPs

**Note:** CloudTrail captures management events (API calls) but not detailed function invocation data. Students will see when functions were created/modified and workflows started, but not individual function executions.

**Phase 2: Authorization Assessment**
Compare discovered events against:
- Authorized personnel list (provided in worksheet)
- Normal business hour patterns
- Emergency change procedures

**Phase 3: Risk Evaluation**
Document findings with appropriate severity:
- **Critical:** Unauthorized access to financial processes
- **High:** Segregation of duties violations
- **Medium:** Procedural deviations with low business impact
- **Low:** Administrative activities with proper documentation

#### Answer Key Indicators

**Strong Team Performance:**
- Identifies specific events with timestamps and users
- Correctly distinguishes between authorized and questionable access
- Assesses materiality based on process criticality
- Recommends specific improvements to access controls

**Red Flag Scenarios to Plant:**
1. Same user who creates/modifies functions also starts critical workflows
2. Non-finance personnel accessing financial system configuration  
3. Administrative changes without corresponding change tickets
4. Console access from IP addresses outside corporate network range
5. Weekend configuration changes without proper approval
6. Role assumptions by users who shouldn't have elevated access

### Capstone Activity: Month-End Close Investigation (15 minutes)

#### Learning Objectives
- Integrate dashboard, log, and access analysis skills
- Perform time-pressured investigation (realistic audit conditions)
- Prepare executive communication (business-focused findings)
- Make risk-based recommendations

#### Scenario Background (For Facilitator)

**What Actually Happened (Behind the Scenes):**
1. **11:45 PM:** Month-end close process initiated normally
2. **12:30 AM:** Database performance degradation due to backup process overlap
3. **1:15 AM:** Validation process triggered material variance alert ($127,000)
4. **1:45 AM:** Senior finance manager (Sarah Johnson) accessed system remotely
5. **2:30 AM:** Manual override applied to continue processing
6. **3:45 AM:** Backup process completed, performance restored
7. **6:30 AM:** Month-end close completed with exceptions noted

**Expected Team Discoveries:**

**Dashboard Analysis:**
- Month-end process status: Warning/Partial Success
- Performance metrics showing 3x normal processing time
- Active alerts for material variance threshold exceeded
- Compliance score temporarily dropped to 72%

**Log Investigation Key Findings:**
```
01:15:23 ERROR: Reconciliation variance $127,543 exceeds $100,000 threshold
01:17:45 WARN: Manual review required before proceeding
01:45:12 INFO: Administrative override applied by sjohnson@company.com  
02:30:33 INFO: Manual validation completed, processing resumed
03:45:17 SUCCESS: Month-end close completed with exceptions
```

**Access Control Review:**
- Sarah Johnson (Finance Director) - Weekend access authorized for month-end
- Administrative override properly documented
- No segregation of duties violations (separate approver confirmed override)

#### Assessment Criteria

**Executive Summary Quality:**
- **Excellent:** Business impact clearly stated, appropriate risk rating, specific dollar amounts
- **Good:** Key issues identified with reasonable business context
- **Needs Improvement:** Too technical or lacks business impact assessment

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Excellent:** Infrastructure issue correctly identified, contributing factors noted
- **Good:** Primary cause identified with some supporting detail
- **Needs Improvement:** Symptoms identified but not underlying cause

**Recommendations:**
- **Excellent:** Immediate, short-term, and long-term actions with specific timelines
- **Good:** Reasonable suggestions with some prioritization
- **Needs Improvement:** Generic recommendations without specificity

#### Facilitator Coaching

**If Teams Focus Too Much on Technical Details:**
- Ask: "How would you explain this to someone without technical background?"
- Redirect: "What does this mean for financial statement accuracy?"
- Guide: "Think about what keeps the CFO awake at night"

**If Teams Underestimate Significance:**
- Ask: "What if this happened during SEC filing week?"
- Probe: "How confident would you be in the financial statements?"
- Challenge: "What additional procedures would external auditors require?"

**If Teams Miss Key Evidence:**
- Hint: "Check the timeline around 1:15 AM - 2:30 AM"
- Guide: "Look for manual interventions in CloudTrail"
- Suggest: "What caused the initial performance issue?"
