## Section 2: Understanding Scheduled Financial Processes (30 minutes)

### Slide 4: Common Financial Processes in AWS
**Examples We'll Monitor Today:**

1. **Daily Transaction Processing**
   - Runs at 2 AM UTC daily
   - Processes 1,000-5,000 transactions
   - Validates data before posting
   - Creates audit trails

2. **Month-End Close Process**
   - Last day of month at 1 AM UTC
   - Multiple sub-processes (reconciliation, accruals, etc.)
   - Critical for financial reporting
   - Zero-tolerance for failures

3. **Financial Data ETL**
   - Daily at 3 AM UTC
   - Extracts from multiple systems
   - Transforms and validates data
   - Loads to data warehouse

### Slide 5: Typical Failure Scenarios
**What Can Go Wrong (and what to look for):**

| Failure Type | Indicators | SOX Impact |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Database Timeouts** | Connection errors, retry attempts | Process delays, incomplete data |
| **Validation Failures** | Business rule violations, data quality issues | Inaccurate financial reporting |
| **Access Violations** | Unauthorized access, privilege escalation | Segregation of duties failures |
| **Reconciliation Variances** | Unbalanced accounts, unexplained differences | Material misstatements |
| **Processing Timeouts** | Incomplete workflows, partial results | Incomplete financial records |

### HANDS-ON ACTIVITY 1: Dashboard Review (15 minutes)
**Access the SOX Compliance Dashboard and identify:**
1. Current status of scheduled processes
2. Any error conditions or warnings
3. Performance metrics and trends
4. Compliance score indicators

**Questions to consider:**
- Are all critical processes running on schedule?
- What is the current error rate?
- Are there any concerning trends?

## Section 3: CloudWatch Logs Investigation (40 minutes)

### Slide 6: Reading Financial Process Logs
**Key Log Patterns to Recognize:**

**SUCCESS Pattern:**
```
[2025-01-22 02:00:15] [INFO] Starting daily transaction processing for 3,247 transactions
[2025-01-22 02:00:15] [INFO] Process initiated by: scheduled-event
[2025-01-22 02:03:42] [INFO] SUCCESS: All 3,247 transactions processed successfully
[2025-01-22 02:03:42] [INFO] Processing completed in 207.5 seconds
```

**FAILURE Pattern:**
```
[2025-01-22 02:00:15] [INFO] Starting daily transaction processing for 4,156 transactions
[2025-01-22 02:00:45] [ERROR] CRITICAL: Database connection timeout - unable to process transactions
[2025-01-22 02:00:45] [ERROR] Error Code: DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
[2025-01-22 02:00:45] [ERROR] Impact: All transactions failed to process
```

### Slide 7: Using CloudWatch Logs Insights
**Sample Queries for SOX Auditors:**

1. **Find all errors in the last 24 hours:**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream
   | filter @message like /ERROR/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 50
   ```

2. **Search for access control violations:**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /CRITICAL/ and @message like /access/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   ```

3. **Track month-end close processes:**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /MONTH-END/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```

### HANDS-ON ACTIVITY 2: Log Investigation (25 minutes)
**Scenario**: The finance team reports that yesterday's transaction processing "seemed slower than usual" and they want to understand if there were any issues.

**Your Task:**
1. Navigate to CloudWatch Logs
2. Search for yesterday's transaction processing logs
3. Identify any errors, warnings, or performance issues
4. Document your findings as audit evidence

**Look for:**
- Processing duration vs. normal times
- Error messages or warnings
- Failed transaction counts
- Any partial processing indicators

**Discussion Questions:**
- What evidence would you document?
- How would you rate the severity of any issues found?
- What follow-up questions would you ask management?

## Section 4: CloudTrail for Access Auditing (25 minutes)

### Slide 8: Understanding CloudTrail Events
**Key Event Types for SOX Auditors:**

| Event Category | Examples | Audit Focus |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Data Access** | GetObject, PutObject | Who accessed financial data |
| **Configuration Changes** | ModifyFunction, UpdateStateMachine | Unauthorized changes |
| **Permission Changes** | AttachPolicy, CreateRole | Privilege escalation |
| **Process Execution** | InvokeFunction, StartExecution | Who initiated processes |

### Slide 9: Critical CloudTrail Filters
**Pre-built searches for common SOX scenarios:**

1. **Administrative Actions:**
   - Event Name: CreateUser, DeleteUser, AttachUserPolicy
   - Focus: Segregation of duties

2. **Financial Process Execution:**
   - Event Name: InvokeFunction, StartExecution
   - Source IP: Look for unusual locations

3. **Data Access Patterns:**
   - Event Name: GetObject, PutObject
   - User Identity: Verify authorized personnel only

### HANDS-ON ACTIVITY 3: CloudTrail Investigation (15 minutes)
**Scenario**: During a routine access review, you need to verify that only authorized personnel have executed financial processes in the last week.

**Your Task:**
1. Open CloudTrail Event History
2. Filter for Lambda function invocations in the last 7 days
3. Review the user identities and source IPs
4. Identify any unusual or unauthorized access

**Red Flags to Look For:**
- Logins from unexpected geographic locations
- Administrative actions by non-admin users
- Process executions outside business hours
- API calls from unknown applications

## Section 5: Hands-On Training Activity (20 minutes)

### MAJOR TRAINING SCENARIO: Monthly Close Investigation

**Background:**
The month-end close process failed last night with a "reconciliation variance" error. The CFO needs to understand:
1. What exactly failed?
2. How much data was affected?
3. Who was involved in the process?
4. What controls failed?

**Your Assignment (Working in pairs):**

#### Phase 1: Process Investigation (10 minutes)
1. **Check the SOX Dashboard**: What alerts are active?
2. **Review Step Functions**: Did the workflow complete?
3. **Examine CloudWatch Logs**: What specific errors occurred?
4. **Quantify Impact**: How many records/dollars were affected?

#### Phase 2: Access Investigation (10 minutes)
1. **CloudTrail Analysis**: Who triggered the month-end process?
2. **Permission Review**: Did anyone modify configurations recently?
3. **Timing Analysis**: Was the process run at the scheduled time?
4. **Exception Review**: Were there any manual interventions?

#### Documentation Requirements:
Create a brief audit finding that includes:
- **Issue Summary**: What went wrong?
- **Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
- **Impact Assessment**: What's the business impact?
- **Evidence**: Screenshots/logs supporting your conclusion
- **Recommendations**: What should be improved?
