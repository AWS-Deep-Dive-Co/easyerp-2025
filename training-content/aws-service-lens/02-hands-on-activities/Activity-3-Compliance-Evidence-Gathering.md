# Activity 3: Compliance Evidence Gathering & Data Processing Controls
## Easy ERP Application - SOX Compliance Monitoring Assessment

### Exercise Introduction

You are conducting the annual SOX audit for **EasyCo Manufacturing**, a publicly traded company that recently migrated their critical financial systems to AWS. Their flagship application, "Easy ERP," processes all financial transactions including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory valuation, and month-end close procedures.

During your planning phase, management informed you that they've implemented comprehensive monitoring and data processing controls in their AWS environment. The CFO specifically mentioned their "automated compliance dashboard" and "real-time financial data validation processes" as key improvements over their legacy on-premises systems.

**Your audit objectives today are to**:
- Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of automated financial data processing controls
- Assess the reliability and completeness of real-time monitoring systems
- Validate that management has adequate visibility into financial data processing activities
- Test the audit trail for critical financial processes

The IT Director has provided you with read-only access to their AWS monitoring environment.
