# Activity 3: Compliance Evidence Gathering & Data Processing Controls
## Easy ERP Application - SOX Compliance Monitoring Assessment

### Exercise Introduction

You are conducting the annual SOX audit for **EasyCo Manufacturing**, a publicly traded company that recently migrated their critical financial systems to AWS. Their flagship application, "Easy ERP," processes all financial transactions including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory valuation, and month-end close procedures.

During your planning phase, management informed you that they've implemented comprehensive monitoring and data processing controls in their AWS environment. The CFO specifically mentioned their "automated compliance dashboard" and "real-time financial data validation processes" as key improvements over their legacy on-premises systems.

**Your audit objectives today are to**:
- Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of automated financial data processing controls
- Assess the reliability and completeness of real-time monitoring systems
- Validate that management has adequate visibility into financial data processing activities
- Test the audit trail for critical financial processes

The IT Director has provided you with read-only access to their AWS monitoring environment.

## EasyCo Financial Control Process Narratives

### Automated Financial Processing (AWS Lambda Functions)

**Business Purpose**: EasyCo has automated their critical financial processes using Lambda functions that run on scheduled intervals to ensure consistent, timely processing of financial transactions.

**Control Process**: 
- **Daily Transaction Processor**: Runs every 5 minutes to process financial transactions with built-in validation and error handling
- **Month-End Processor**: Runs every 15 minutes to handle month-end close procedures, account reconciliation, and variance analysis

**Key Controls**:
- Automated transaction validation and business rule enforcement
- Error handling and exception reporting for failed transactions
- Consistent processing schedules ensure timely financial data processing
- Detailed logging of all transaction processing activities

### Financial Data Validation (AWS Glue ETL Jobs)

**Business Purpose**: Raw financial data from multiple sources must be validated, transformed, and loaded into reporting systems with complete accuracy.

**Control Process**:
- **Financial ETL Job**: Processes and validates financial data every 10 minutes
- **Compliance Validation Job**: Performs SOX compliance checks every 20 minutes

**Key Controls**:
- Data completeness and accuracy validation
- Business rule validation prevents invalid data from entering financial systems
- Automated monitoring of ETL job success/failure rates

### Real-Time Financial Monitoring (CloudWatch)

**Business Purpose**: Management needs continuous visibility into financial operations to ensure processes are functioning correctly.

**Control Process**:
- **SOX Compliance Dashboard**: Tracks key financial control metrics and compliance indicators
- **Operational Dashboard**: Monitors transaction processing and system performance
- **Automated Alerting**: Threshold-based alarms for financial process failures

**Key Controls**:
- Real-time monitoring of transaction processing success rates
- Automated alerting when financial processes exceed error thresholds
- Management visibility into process completion and exception volumes

**Audit Focus**: Look for evidence of data validation controls and proper error handling in ETL processes.

### Step 3: SOX Compliance Monitoring Dashboard (3 minutes)

**Navigate to**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#dashboards:`

**What You're Looking For**: Evidence that management has real-time visibility into financial operations.

**Dashboard Analysis**:
- **Open**: `aws-deep-dive-sox-compliance-monitoring`
- **Open**: `aws-deep-dive-operational-monitoring`
- **Review Key Metrics**:
  - Transaction processing success rates *(Are financial processes meeting performance targets?)*
  - Error rates and failure counts *(How often do financial processes fail?)*
  - Processing times and volumes *(Are financial processes completing timely?)*

**Audit Focus**: Evaluate whether management has adequate visibility into financial processing activities.

### Step 4: Financial Process Alerting (3 minutes)

**Navigate to**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#alarmsV2:`

**What You're Looking For**: Evidence that management is notified when financial processes fail or deviate from acceptable parameters.

**Critical Alerts Investigation**:
- Look for alarms related to `aws-deep-dive` processes
- **Focus on financial-relevant alarms**:
  - `aws-deep-dive-high-transaction-failure-rate`
  - `aws-deep-dive-compliance-score-below-threshold`  
  - `aws-deep-dive-material-variance-detected`
- **Click on individual alarms** to examine:
  - Threshold settings *(Are alert levels set appropriately?)*
  - Alarm history *(How often do financial processes trigger alerts?)*
  - Current alarm state *(Are financial systems currently operating normally?)*

**Audit Focus**: Assess whether exception monitoring is configured appropriately for financial processes.
