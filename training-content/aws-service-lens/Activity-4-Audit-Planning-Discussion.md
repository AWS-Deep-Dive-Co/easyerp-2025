## Discussion Framework

### Table Discussion Questions (10 minutes)

**Question 1**: **Risk Prioritization**
"What's the highest audit risk in this integrated AWS environment and why?"

**Question 2**: **Testing Innovation**
"How would your testing approach differ from a traditional IT environment?"

**Question 3**: **Evidence Strategy**
"What evidence would provide the most assurance with the least audit effort?"

**Question 4**: **Resource Challenges**
"What skills or resources would be most challenging to obtain for this audit?"

**Question 5**: **Client Communication**
"How would you explain your audit approach to client management?"

### Large Group Sharing (5 minutes)

**Each table should be prepared to share**:
1. **Primary audit risk** identified
2. **Most innovative testing approach** developed
3. **Biggest challenge** anticipated
4. **Key insight** from the discussion

## Facilitator Instructions

### Setup (2 minutes)
- **Organize tables** of 4-5 participants each (mix experience levels)
- **Distribute materials** and emphasize collaborative approach
- **Set expectations**: Focus on practical audit planning, not perfect solutions

### Table Discussion Phase (10 minutes)
- **Circulate between tables** to listen and guide discussions
- **Keep discussions practical**: "What would you actually do?"
- **Encourage diverse perspectives**: "How might others approach this differently?"
- **Manage time**: Guide through phases, give warnings at 7 and 9 minutes

### Facilitator Interventions:

**If groups struggle with AWS specifics**:
*"Focus on the business processes - how would you audit any automated system?"*

**If discussions become too technical**:
*"Remember, you're planning an audit, not implementing the technology."*

**If groups move too quickly**:
*"Take time to think about the practical challenges - what could go wrong?"*

**If groups get stuck**:
*"What would you do if this were a traditional system? How might that apply here?"*

### Large Group Sharing (3 minutes)
- **Call on tables randomly** to share insights
- **Focus on key themes** that emerge across groups
- **Highlight innovative approaches** and practical solutions
- **Connect to earlier training content**

- Cloud environments provide richer evidence sources
- Continuous monitoring enables ongoing assurance
- Analytics and automation can improve audit efficiency

**Risk-Based Focus**:
- Technology doesn't change fundamental audit risk assessment
- Cloud services create new risk types but familiar risk categories
- Integration risks may be higher but individual service risks may be lower
- Focus on business impact rather than technical complexity

**Practical Implementation**:
- Start with business process understanding
- Leverage client's cloud expertise and tools
- Develop cloud audit capabilities gradually
- Focus on evidence reliability and audit efficiency

This activity effectively synthesizes the training content into practical audit planning skills while encouraging collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing among participants.
