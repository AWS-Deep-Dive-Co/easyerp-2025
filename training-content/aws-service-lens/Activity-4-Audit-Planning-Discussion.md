"What's the highest audit risk in this integrated AWS environment and why?"

**Question 2**: **Testing Innovation**
"How would your testing approach differ from a traditional IT environment?"

**Question 3**: **Evidence Strategy**
"What evidence would provide the most assurance with the least audit effort?"

**Question 4**: **Resource Challenges**
"What skills or resources would be most challenging to obtain for this audit?"

**Question 5**: **Client Communication**
"How would you explain your audit approach to client management?"

### Large Group Console Insights Sharing (5 minutes)

**Each table should be prepared to share**:
1. **Most significant audit risk** identified from console observations
2. **Most valuable console evidence** discovered in Activities 1-3  
3. **Biggest console-based testing opportunity** developed
4. **Key insight** about console-enhanced audit approach

## Facilitator Instructions

### Pre-Activity Preparation
- **Verify Console Completion**: Ensure all participants completed Activities 1-3 console exploration
- **Materials Ready**: Participants should have their console observation worksheets available
- **Table Organization**: Mix participants with different console findings for richer discussion

### Activity Facilitation

**Setup (2 minutes)**:
- **Organize tables** of 4-5 participants (mix console experience levels)
- **Distribute materials** and remind participants to reference console worksheets
- **Set expectations**: Build on actual console observations, not hypothetical scenarios

**Table Discussion Phase (10 minutes)**:
- **Encourage console evidence sharing**: "What did you actually see in the console?"
- **Connect observations to audit risks**: "How does what you observed impact audit planning?"
- **Keep discussions practical**: "Based on your console experience, what would you actually test?"
- **Guide toward integration**: "How would you combine console evidence with traditional audit procedures?"

**Time Management**:
- **3-minute mark**: Ensure groups are progressing through risk assessment
- **7-minute mark**: Guide toward testing strategy development  
- **9-minute mark**: Focus on practical audit approach

### Console-Specific Facilitator Interventions

**If groups struggle to connect console observations to audit risks**:
*"Think about what you saw in Activity 2 - what could go wrong with those Step Functions workflows?"*

**If discussions become too abstract**:
*"Go back to your console worksheets - what specific evidence did you document?"*

**If groups move too quickly through console evidence**:
*"Take time to really think about what you observed - what audit questions did that raise?"*

**If groups get stuck on technical details**:
*"Focus on the business impact - what financial statement assertions are at risk?"*

### Large Group Sharing (3 minutes)
- **Call on tables randomly** to share console-based insights
- **Highlight connections** between console observations and audit strategy
- **Emphasize practical applications** of hands-on console experience
- **Connect to real-world audit implications**
