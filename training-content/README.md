- ‚úÖ Demonstrating specific business process automation
- ‚úÖ SOX compliance requirements are important
- ‚úÖ Participants need prescriptive, scenario-based learning
- ‚úÖ Business process outcomes are the primary goal

### Use Technical Service Focus When:
- ‚úÖ Training cloud engineers or developers
- ‚úÖ Exploring AWS service capabilities and patterns
- ‚úÖ Participants prefer discovery-based learning
- ‚úÖ Cross-service integration understanding is important
- ‚úÖ AWS service mastery is the primary goal

### Use Combined Approach When:
- ‚úÖ Training mixed audiences (business + technical)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrating business value AND technical implementation
- ‚úÖ Creating comprehensive AWS training programs
- ‚úÖ Building understanding across different professional perspectives

## Content Reusability

**Single Source, Multiple Perspectives**:
- All training content uses identical AWS infrastructure
- Content can be adapted based on audience needs and focus areas
- Facilitators can adjust emphasis during training sessions
- Participants get consistent hands-on experience regardless of focus

**Extensibility**:
- Add new content modules without changing infrastructure
- Customize scenarios for specific industries or use cases
- Scale from individual workshops to comprehensive programs
- Support both instructor-led and self-paced learning approaches

## Quick Start Guide

### For Business Process Focused Training:
1. Deploy infrastructure using unified template
2. Follow `aws-service-lens/02-hands-on-activities/Manual-Deployment-Guide.md`
3. Use SOX compliance scenarios and financial workflow emphasis
4. Reference `aws-service-lens/01-general-training-materials/Common-Resources.md` for troubleshooting

### For Technical Service Focused Training:
1. Deploy infrastructure using unified template  
2. Follow `aws-service-lens/01-general-training-materials/AWS-Service-Exploration-Guide.md`
3. Use `aws-service-lens/04-facilitator-resources/Training-Facilitator-Guide.md` for workshop delivery
4. Reference `aws-service-lens/01-general-training-materials/Common-Resources.md` for common procedures

### For Mixed Audience Training:
1. Deploy infrastructure using unified template
2. Combine business process scenarios with technical deep-dives
3. Use live demo materials from `aws-service-lens/03-live-demo-materials/`
4. Adapt content focus based on participant backgrounds during delivery
